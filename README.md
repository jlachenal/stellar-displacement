# stellar-displacement

Hi! This is a Processing sketch that utilizes Daniel Shiffman's Microsoft Kinect library to track a hand outfitted with a special infrared controller.

The movements are displayed on a tableau of "stars," and participants are invited to connect the dots to build their own constellations.

After a set amount of time (~27s), the stars "reset" by scrambling themselves all over the screen.

This project was developed as part of the Gray Area Creative Code Immersive program (Spring 2017 Cohort).

Immense thanks go to Issac Kelly and Niki Selken for their guidance in the creation of this project.
